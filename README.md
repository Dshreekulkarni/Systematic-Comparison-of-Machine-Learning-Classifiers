This project evaluates the performance of three classifiers on three different datasets across 3 different train-test splits. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models were trained and tested on each dataset using three train–test partitions (20/80, 50/50, and 80/20) to examine cross-dataset performance differences, and the effect of training size on model accuracy, precision, and recall. Across nearly all datasets and partitions, Random Forest achieved the highest overall performance. The changes in evaluation metrics for each classifier as training size increases is also analyzed.
